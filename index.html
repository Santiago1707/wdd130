    <p>Hi, I'm Santiago Mendoza, I’m from Bogotá, Colombia, and I recently moved to Canada with my mom and sister. 
        We now live with my mom’s husband. In my free time, I enjoy watching series while coding, which helps me relax and stay inspired. 
        I used to work for Capital One Bank, where I gained valuable experience in the finance sector.
        In addition to my professional interests, I have a passion for sports, particularly basketball and volleyball. 
        I love the teamwork and strategy involved in both games. I also enjoy playing video games, 
        which is a great way to unwind and connect with friends.
        Overall, I’m excited about this new chapter in Canada and look forward to exploring new opportunities both personally and professionally.</p>
